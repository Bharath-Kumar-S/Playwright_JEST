Playwright provides a set of APIs to automate Chromium, Firefox and WebKit browsers. By using the Playwright API, you can write JavaScript code to create new browser pages, navigate to URLs and then interact with elements on a page.

Along with a test runner Playwright can be used to automate user interactions to validate and test web applications.

`npm i` or `npm install` to pull all dependencies in package.json from npmjs.org. 

`npm run test` to execute the tests in headless mode.

`npm run test --brw=true` to execute tests in headful mode.
